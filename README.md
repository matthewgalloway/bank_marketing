# A Comparison of Naive Bayes and Tree Based Ensembles Applied to the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

## Motivation and problem description

Data driven decision making (business intelligence) is becoming more common as data sources and machine capabilities increase. When engaging with clients these often presents binary classification problems, will a client buy the business's product? 

As the majority of customers do not respond to marketing, datasets are highly unbalanced leading models to take a majority vote. Data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE, SMOTEEN, RUS and more recently GAN's have shown success in the literature at fixing class inbalances.

This work seeks to investigate the relationship between performance, resampling techinques and algorithms on a bank marketing data set commonly used as a bench mark for new techniques https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php.
